Algorithms

This repo mainly contains algorithms and data structures done in javascript.
---

Recursion.js
Recursion is defined as a process which calls itself directly or indirectly and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
---

mergeSort.js
Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. It follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into two halves, recursively sorting the two halves and finally merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.

LinkedList.js.js
A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque.

HashMap.js
A HashMap (also known as a dictionary or hash table in other programming languages) is a collection of key-value pairs 
---

BinarySearchTrees.js
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree data structure in which each node contains a unique key and satisfies a specific ordering property:

  - All nodes in the left subtree of a node contain values strictly less than the node’s value.
  - All nodes in the right subtree of a node contain values strictly greater than the node’s value.

This structure enables efficient operations for searching, insertion, and deletion of elements, especially when the tree remains balanced.
