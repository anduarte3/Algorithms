# Algorithms

This repo mainly contains algorithms and data structures implemented in **JavaScript**.

---

## Recursion

Recursion is a process where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. The function involved in this process is called a **recursive function**.

---

## mergeSort

Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its **efficiency** and **stability**. It uses a **divide-and-conquer** approach by:

- Recursively dividing the input array into two halves.
- Sorting each half recursively.
- Merging the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

## LinkedList

A linked list is a fundamental data structure that allows efficient **insertion** and **deletion** operations compared to arrays. It is often used to implement other data structures like:

- Stack
- Queue
- Deque

---

## HashMap

A HashMap (also called a dictionary or hash table in other languages) is a collection of **key-value pairs**, allowing fast data retrieval based on keys.

---

## Binary Search Trees

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a special kind of binary tree where each node contains a unique key and follows these properties:

- All nodes in the **left subtree** have values **less than** the node’s value.
- All nodes in the **right subtree** have values **greater than** the node’s value.

This structure allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion, especially when the tree is balanced.

## KnightTravails

This project finds the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
